Added project description and filled in required project technologies. The Google API requirement seems arbitrary imo.

The project is a culmination of many ideas and themes I've been thinking about for awhile. It's not a new idea; science fiction has been heralding the revolutionary advent of machine intelligence, robotics, self aware devices for over 100 years, but the difference is instead of some distance far off future, this will be our reality in a few decades.

As machines approach the level of biological complexity, advent of remote cloud based computation and ubitious sensing technology will radically transform how we interact and control machines, transforming work, architecture, clothing and our very bodies. This is an exploration of a future yet unborn.
