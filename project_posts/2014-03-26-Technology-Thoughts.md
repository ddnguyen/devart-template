I imagine the wall to be composed of small articulated robots ( tetrahedron shaped rolly polly like things ). Instead of making the wall from smart robotic elements, they are more simple robotic elements who share their computational and energy across a dynamic network. They have the ability to adhere or repel each other on their joining surfaces using magnetic forces. The culminate effect of many pieces create coordinated locomotive action, giving the Wall a more organic presence than a mechanical one. 
One of the problems is that to coordinate such dynamic action you need lots of processing power. More processing power than a single tetra ( short for tetrahedron ) can provide nor even a network of 1000s of them can provide. That is why they are slaved to a master CPU which is needed to simulate their procedural motion. The Mother CPU is a powerful workstation equipped with powerful GPUs running physical simulators to do motion projects for the Wall AI.
