Some Wall ideas. The wall could be composed of cubes dissected into tetrahedrons. Each face of the tetrahedron could have some sort of anchoring element which allows it to anchor to another face. Or maybe the edges are the only anchor points and allow the tetrahedron to swing along that axis, perhaps using magnetic forces..
